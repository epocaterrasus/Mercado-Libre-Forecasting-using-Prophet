## Installation and Usage Guide

### Using Google Colab

In this project, we used Google Colab instead of using our traditional IDEs or Jupyter Lab, Google Colab is very similar to a Jupyter Notebook but does not require us to install libraries and dependencies on our local machine but rather install and import them directly onto the platform. The platform comes with many preinstalled libraries so it is only necessary to install some as you can see on the code.
